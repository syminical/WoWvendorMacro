# WoW 3.3.5 Vendor Recipe Macro

This macro can quickly purchase **[Formula: Runed Arcanite Rod]** from Lorelae Wintersong in Moonglade. It can be customized to work with any vendor
and any items they sell.

### Setup:
1. In-game press esc to bring up the menu, then click on the **Macros** button.
2. Create a new macro, enter a name, pick an icon. ( A single space looks best, imo. )
3. Paste the code into the text box.
4. Drag the macro icon to your hotkey bar. ( Remember this slot! )
5. Press esc again, and click **Key Bindings**.
6. Bind the slot holding the macro to your mouse's scroll wheel.
7. Scroll down to **Targeting Fuctions**, and bind **Interact With Target** to the other direction of the mouse wheel.
8. Consider making a separate macro to target the npc, just in case.
  * ```
  /target Lorelae Wintersong```

### Use:
1. Have the NPC targeted
2. Scroll the mouse wheel in the direction that you bound to open the shop.
3. Scroll the mouse wheel in the other direciton.
4. Repeat.

### Advice:
* This particular recipe respawned every 15 min on my server, and the npc's death did not restart the item's timer.
* The vendor sells it for 2g20s, so come prepared.
